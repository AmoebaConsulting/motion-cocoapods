== motion-cocoapods

motion-cocoapods allows RubyMotion projects to integrate with the CocoaPods dependency manager.

=== Requirements

* CocoaPods.

  $ sudo gem install cocoapods

* RubyMotion 1.0 or greater (see http://www.rubymotion.com).

=== Installation

  $ sudo gem install motion-cocoapods

=== Setup

1. Edit the +Rakefile+ of your RubyMotion project and add the following require line.

     require 'motion/project/cocoapods'

2. Still in the +Rakefile+, set your dependencies using the same language as you would do in Podfiles.

     Motion::Project::App.setup do |app|
       # ...
       app.pods do
         dependency 'JSONKit'
       end
     end

That's all. The build system will properly download the given pods and their dependencies, build them and link them to your application executable.
